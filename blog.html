       <h2>Academic</h2>
       <p> Starting from Spetember 2024, I will be publishing exciting Medium posts on different topics (e.g stochastic calculus introduction) in fields like quantum computing, mathematics, machine learning and quantitative finance. Unforutnately, I am not financially stable to pay the membership fee ($60 per year). Nevertheless, stay tuned! &#x1F609;</p>

       <h2>Personal</h2>
       <p>Being physically challenged and coming from a low-income family has exposed me to many breathtaking experiences. As a first-generation student, I am constantly pursuing opportunities both at home and abroad to bring out the best in myself. Despite my zeal, financial barriers have been a persistent hindrance to my personal growth. Countless times, I have mentally broken down and considered giving up, but I simply couldn't. Here are some of the prestigious and highly competitive opportunities I have missed out on due to financial limitations:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>HackMIT 2024:</strong> My parents could not conveniently afford the visa fee and flight expenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Learning Indaba 2024 (largest AI conference in Africa):</strong> I was unable to afford the travel expenses to Senegal.</li>
        <li><strong>2024 RTG2491 Autumn School "From T-duality via K-theory to representation theory":</strong> Although my accommodations were covered, I could not afford the visa and travel expenses to Germany.</li>
        <li><strong>Representation Theory and Related Geometry: Progress and Prospects conference:</strong> I received a visa invitation to attend this event at the University of Georgia, USA, but sadly, I couldn't go due to a lack of financial support.</li>
       </ul>
