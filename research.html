       <h2>Research Interests</h2>
       <p>While my research interests are presently not super-specific, they lie in many interrelated academic disciplines. My research interests span Analysis of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations(PDEs), Algebraic Number Theory, Computational Learning Theory, Generative Models, and High-dimensional Statistics, Quantum Algorithms and Complexity Theory.</p>

       <h2>Research Experiences</h2>
       <p>My formal research experience started with the ReachSci STEM Mini-PhD programme, organized at the University of Cambridge, where my team and I worked on quantization and diacritics of a low-resource language model. I recently concluded my internship at QIntern, where I worked on using the HHL algorithm to solve two-dimensional wave equations. Furthermore, I am also conducting an independent mathematics research on Littlewood’s Cosine Root Problem, which I luckily came across on Professor Stefan Steinerberger’s website from the University of Washington. This idea of independent research was birthed primarily because there are little to no real research opportunities for non-final-year students at my home university.</p>
