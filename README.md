        <h1 class="header">HOME</h1>
        <p>I am currently an undergraduate student of Obafemi Awolowo University, studying BSc. in Computer Science with Mathematics. I will be starting my third-year studies in the next few months.</p>
        <p>I am a proud autodidact and always ready to pursue knowledge that is far beyond my age group. Additionally, I am enrolled in the MITx MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science. Here is my <a href="#">CV</a> and <a href="mailto:your-email@example.com">email address</a>.</p>
        <p>I am actively looking for a research internship!</p>
        <p>My extracurricular activities are quantum computing, theoretical machine learning, competitive programming, quantitative finance, creative writing, and chess.</p>

        <h2>RESEARCH INTERESTS & EXPERIENCES</h2>
        <p>While my research interests are presently not super-specific, they lie in many interrelated academic disciplines. In mathematics, I am interested in the analysis of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and Algebraic Number Theory. In machine learning, I am interested in computational learning theory, generative models, and high-dimensional statistics. Lastly, in quantum computing, I am interested in quantum algorithms and complexity theory.</p>
        <p>My formal research experience started with the ReachSci STEM Mini-PhD programme, organized at the University of Cambridge, where my team and I worked on quantization and diacritics of a low-resource language model. I am currently interning at QIntern, where I am working on using the HHL algorithm to solve two-dimensional wave equations. Furthermore, I am also conducting independent mathematics research on Littlewood’s Cosine Root Problem, which I luckily came across on Professor Stefan Steinerberger’s website from the University of Washington. This idea of independent research was birthed primarily because there are little to no real research opportunities for non-final-year students at my home university.</p>

        <h2>PERSONAL PROJECTS</h2>
        <p>I have a handful of personal projects that I intend to work on throughout the next six months. The two I began with are below (specific details are intentionally excluded). Presently, I am still in the preliminary phase.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Homology detection with graph neural networks</li>
            <li>A speech-to-speech model capable of generating a real-time hyper-realistic image of a user with excellent lip-syncing of the receiving language during virtual meetings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More details about these can be inquired through my email.</p>

        <h2>OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS</h2>
        <p>Check out my first open-source project <a href="#">here</a>. Feel free to contribute!</p>

        <h2>BLOG</h2>
        <p>I will be publishing two articles before August 31, 2024, on the foundations of Black-Scholes Models and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations. The current delay lies in updating my website fully with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, feel free to check out my experience with the 2024 Alibaba Mathematics Competition and other interesting articles on my LinkedIn!</p>

        <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
        <p>I am a huge fan of STEM competitions and am actively preparing for these major competitions in 2024-25: Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition, Microsoft Imagine Cup, Meta Hacker Cup, IEEE Xtreme Programming Competition, Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, and MIT Informatics Tournament.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, in September 2022, I founded a Data Science/ML community with 849 members from 9+ countries as of now.</p>
